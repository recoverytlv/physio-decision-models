# Non-Response as Diagnostic Signal

## Premise
In biological systems, lack of response is not absence of information.

## Definition
Non-response is defined as the absence of meaningful system change following a controlled perturbation within an expected temporal window.

## Clinical Interpretation
Non-response constrains the hypothesis space more strongly than partial improvement.

## Decision Consequences
- Repetition without hypothesis revision increases decision error.
- Strategy persistence under stasis indicates epistemic inertia.
- Early recognition of non-response reduces iatrogenic dependency.

## Exit Logic
When successive perturbations fail to produce informative signal, exit or referral is the rational endpoint.
