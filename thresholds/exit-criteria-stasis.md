# Criteria for Intervention Cessation in Clinical Stasis

## 1. Definition of Stasis
Clinical stasis is defined as the absence of meaningful change in observed biological signals following a finite sequence of controlled perturbations. Stasis is not neutral; it is an informative boundary that invalidates the current working hypothesis.

## 2. Thresholds for Hypothesis Invalidation
Continuation of intervention beyond the following thresholds constitutes accumulated decision error:

- **Signal Invariance:** No relevant symptomatic or functional variation after three (3) high-fidelity interventions.
- **Dose–Response Decoupling:** Increased intensity or frequency without proportional system response.
- **Noise Dominance:** Variability unrelated to mechanical, neurophysiological, or contextual loading.

## 3. Mandatory Exit Conditions
Intervention must be suspended when:
- Further perturbation increases dependency risk without trajectory modification.
- Observed signals remain within baseline biological noise.
- The cost of continuation exceeds the probability of a non-linear system shift.

## 4. Epistemic Status of Exit
Treatment cessation under stasis is not failure. It represents epistemic closure of the current hypothesis and mandates re-evaluation, redirection, or referral.

## 5. Decision Rule
`If Perturbation[n] == Signal_Baseline AND Perturbation[n+1] == Signal_Baseline → HALT_INTERVENTION`
