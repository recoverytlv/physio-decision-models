# SYSTEM SCOPE

This repository defines a minimal, canonical decision-governed model for physiotherapy  
operating under irreducible biological uncertainty.

## What this system IS

A formal epistemic structure for clinical reasoning that treats physiotherapy as:  
- a continuous adaptive decision system  
- hypothesis generation → controlled perturbation → signal observation → revision/exit  
- interpretation of non-response/stasis as high-value diagnostic constraint  
- explicit boundaries on continuation to minimize accumulated decision error  

Core purpose:  
- Formalize how to constrain therapeutic persistence  
- Define clear terminal states (consolidation, revision, exit, referral, obsolescence)  
- Prioritize decision integrity over intervention volume or indefinite care  

## What this system is NOT

- A catalogue of treatment techniques or protocols  
- A guide to optimize clinical outcomes or timelines  
- A promise of improvement, resolution speed, or patient retention  
- A patient-facing clinical service description  
- A marketing artifact or SEO content  
- An open-ended evolving framework  

It deliberately rejects:  
- Indefinite continuation without strong evidential update  
- Narrative/emotional framing of care  
- Equation of therapeutic activity with clinical value  

This is not a patient tool. It is a reference model for epistemic governance in physiotherapy.

## Problems it solves

- Persistent error accumulation in non-responding cases  
- Absence of formal exit criteria in uncertain biological systems  
- Over-interpretation of stasis as failure instead of diagnostic signal  
- Lack of bounded decision paths in complex adaptive patient-therapist interactions  

## Problems it explicitly rejects / does not attempt to solve

- How to select or sequence specific interventions  
- Prediction or guarantee of symptom resolution  
- Patient education materials  
- Operational/clinic management questions  
- Maximization of session volume or revenue  

## Final boundary statement

This is a frozen reference model (v1.0.0).  
Its value lies in its narrowness, closure, and resistance to expansion.  
Any attempt to widen scope, add procedures, or introduce outcome promises  
is outside the defined system and should be considered a fork, not an evolution.
